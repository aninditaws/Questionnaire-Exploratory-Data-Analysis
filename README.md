# Exploratory Data Analysis on Questionnaire Results

## Project Overview
This project is the final assignment for the course **II2111-19 Probability & Statistics**. The primary objective is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on questionnaire results. The analysis includes data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and visualization to extract meaningful insights and identify trends within the data. The findings aim to support data-driven decision-making processes.

## Files in the Repository

1. **18222128_Anindita_Widya_Santoso_TugasBesarProbStat.ipynb**
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for the analysis. It covers all steps from data cleaning to result visualization, with detailed comments and structured code cells for replicable analysis.

2. **18222128_Anindita_Widya_Santoso_TugasBesarProbStat.html**
   - An HTML version of the notebook, designed for easy sharing and viewing without requiring a Jupyter environment.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, correcting formatting issues, and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the data with metrics such as mean, median, mode, and frequency distributions.
- **Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots, to identify patterns and trends.
- **Insights**: Extracting and interpreting key findings to provide actionable insights.
